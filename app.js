//when app loads, randomly selects two deep sea creatures from deep sea img file

//ask visitor to vote on which creature is the weirdest

//after voting, highlight winning deep sea photo

//chart relative popularity of these two photos 
			//(start with the Chart.js API)

//increase total votes for winning photo by one

//ask visitor to vote for two new random deep sea photos

//------------------NOTES--------------------------------

//A set of Photo objects to manage all the attributes and behaviors around kitten photos.
//A single Tracker object to manage all the attributes and behaviors around a visitor's voting experience.

//User voting on images = primary interactivity
//Storing running vote totals/displaying in chart(s) using Chart.JS = primary technical challenge
